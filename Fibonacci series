Write a Java program to print the Fibonacci series up to a given number using a for loop.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class FibonacciSeries {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the number of terms: ");
        int count = scanner.nextInt();

        int firstTerm = 0, secondTerm = 1;

        System.out.print("Fibonacci Series up to " + count + " terms: ");
        for (int i = 1; i <= count; ++i) {
            System.out.print(firstTerm + " ");

            // Compute the next term in the series
            int nextTerm = firstTerm + secondTerm;
            firstTerm = secondTerm;
            secondTerm = nextTerm;
        }
    }
}
